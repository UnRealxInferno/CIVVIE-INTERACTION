# Civilian Interaction System - Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Dialog Text Improvements**

**Problem**: 
- Dialog said "6 meters to the ANY" (broken direction)
- Made up fake time references ("a few minutes ago")
- Overly specific distances (exact meters)

**Solution**:
- Removed all fake time references
- Added distance rounding to nearest 100m (configurable)
- Added variety of response texts using `selectRandom`
- Both enemy and mine intel now use map markers instead of text directions

**Changed Files**:
- `fn_processInteractionResponse.sqf` - Updated dialog text with 4 varied responses per intel type

### 2. ✅ **Map Marker System**

**Problem**: 
- Enemy intel had broken compass direction text
- Mine intel had incomplete marker system

**Solution**:
- Enemy intel: RED markers with "Enemy Spotted" text (5min duration)
- Mine intel: YELLOW markers with "Possible Mine" text (10min duration)
- Both auto-delete after configurable time periods
- Markers placed at exact threat locations

### 3. ✅ **Enemy Detection Fix**

**Problem**: 
- Hardcoded to only detect `east` and `independent` sides
- Wouldn't work properly in all mission scenarios

**Solution**:
- Now uses `[side _civilian, side _x] call BIS_fnc_sideIsEnemy`
- Properly detects any hostile sides relative to civilians
- Updated both `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf` and `fn_checkNearbyEnemies.sqf`

### 4. ✅ **Enhanced Mine Detection**

**Problem**: 
- Only checked `MineBase` class
- Missed some IED types

**Solution**:
- Now checks both `MineBase` and `TimeBomb` classes
- Better coverage of all explosive threats
- Updated both mine detection functions

### 5. ✅ **CBA Settings Integration**

**Problem**: 
- All values were hardcoded
- No way for users to customize the system

**Solution**:
- Full CBA Settings integration with 12 configurable parameters
- Fallback system when CBA is not available
- Settings categories: Core, Reputation, Detection, Markers, Dialog, Debug

**New CBA Settings**:
- `CI_INTEL_RANGE` - Intelligence detection range (500-3000m, default 1000m)
- `CI_INTERACTION_RANGE` - Interaction distance (3-20m, default 10m)
- `CI_STARTING_REPUTATION` - Starting reputation (0-100, default 50)
- `CI_BASE_SUCCESS_CHANCE` - Base cooperation chance (0.1-1.0, default 0.5)
- `CI_ENEMY_DETECTION_CHANCE` - Enemy detection chance (0.1-1.0, default 1.0)
- `CI_MINE_DETECTION_CHANCE` - Mine detection chance (0.05-1.0, default 0.8)
- `CI_ENEMY_MARKER_DURATION` - Enemy marker duration (60-1800s, default 300s)
- `CI_MINE_MARKER_DURATION` - Mine marker duration (60-1800s, default 600s)
- `CI_DISTANCE_ROUNDING` - Distance rounding (50m/100m/200m, default 100m)
- `CI_ENABLE_GENERAL_CHAT` - Enable general conversation
- `CI_REQUIRE_LINE_OF_SIGHT` - Line of sight requirement (experimental)
- `CI_DEBUG_MODE` - Debug messages

All issues have been resolved and the system is now production-ready with full customization support!

## Latest Updates (Current Version)

### 6. ✅ **Major IED Detection Enhancement**

**Problem**: 
- Still missing many IED types in actual gameplay
- Some explosive devices not being detected despite string matching
- Limited to basic MineBase and TimeBomb classes

**Solution**:
- **Comprehensive Class Checking**: Added checks for `Explosive`, `SatchelCharge_Remote_Mag`, `DemoCharge_Remote_Mag` classes
- **Extensive String Pattern Matching**: Now searches for IED, Mine, Charge, Explosive, Bomb, Demo, C4, Claymore, Landmine, Suicide, Roadside, Anomaly, Trap
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: All string checks converted to uppercase for reliability
- **Enhanced Debug Output**: Shows object name, classname, and distance for better troubleshooting
- **Consolidated Detection Logic**: All explosive detection now handled in `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf`

**Key Changes**:
```sqf
// Now checks these classes:
(_x isKindOf "MineBase") or           // Traditional mines
(_x isKindOf "TimeBomb") or           // Timer bombs and many IEDs  
(_x isKindOf "Explosive") or          // Generic explosives
(_x isKindOf "Thing") or              // Many placed explosives
// Plus extensive string matching and exact classname lists
```

### 7. ✅ **Cluster Enemy Detection**

**Problem**: 
- Each enemy was reported individually even when they were grouped together
- No indication when multiple enemies were operating as a unit

**Solution**:
- Added cluster detection that groups nearby enemies (within 150m)
- Civilians now report "I saw 3 armed men..." instead of just "I saw armed men..."
- Map markers show "Enemy Group (X)" for clusters vs "Enemy Spotted" for individuals
- Improved realism: civilians naturally notice groups of enemies together

**Changed Files**:
- `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf` - Added two-pass detection system for clustering
- `fn_processInteractionResponse.sqf` - Updated to handle cluster data format

### 8. ✅ **Improved Close-Range Distance Reporting**

**Problem**: 
- Enemies very close to civilians were reported as "0 meters away"
- Unrealistic and unhelpful distance reporting for nearby threats

**Solution**:
- Enemies within 100m now reported as "really close by" instead of distance
- Applied to both enemy and mine intel for consistency
- More natural and urgent language for immediate threats

**Changed Files**:
- `fn_processInteractionResponse.sqf` - Added distance-based text formatting

### 9. ✅ **Mine/Explosive Cluster Detection**

**Problem**: 
- Each mine/explosive was reported individually even when part of a minefield
- No indication when explosives were placed in defensive patterns

**Solution**:
- Added cluster detection that groups nearby mines/explosives (within 50m)
- Civilians now report "minefield with 4 explosives..." instead of individual mines
- Map markers show "Minefield (X)" for clusters vs "Possible Mine" for individuals
- More urgent language: "Be very careful!" for minefields vs single mines
- Realistic reporting: civilians naturally notice defensive explosive patterns

**Changed Files**:
- `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf` - Added mine clustering system with 50m radius
- `fn_processInteractionResponse.sqf` - Updated to handle mine cluster data format

### 10. ✅ **Distance-Based Threat Prioritization**

**Problem**: 
- Civilians would randomly report enemy/mine clusters regardless of distance
- Could report enemies 800m away while ignoring closer threats at 200m
- Not tactically useful - players need intel on immediate threats first

**Solution**:
- Intelligence now prioritizes closest enemy clusters and minefields
- Replaced `selectRandom` with closest-distance algorithm
- Civilians always report the most immediate threat first
- Tactical advantage: Players get actionable intel about nearby dangers

**Changed Files**:
- `fn_processInteractionResponse.sqf` - Added distance-based prioritization for both enemy and mine intel

### 9. ✅ **Code Simplification and Cleanup**

**Problem**: 
- Redundant functions with duplicated detection logic
- `fn_checkNearbyMines.sqf` and `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf` had identical explosive detection code
- Unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden

**Solution**:
- **Removed Redundant Function**: Eliminated `fn_checkNearbyMines.sqf` entirely
- **Consolidated Logic**: All explosive detection now in `fn_gatherIntelligence.sqf` with probability-based realism
- **Updated Configuration**: Removed function from `config.cpp` CfgFunctions
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Single source of truth for explosive detection logic

### 10. ✅ **System Simplification and Cleanup**

**Problem**: 
- Complex CBA integration added unnecessary complexity
- Root directory cluttered with test files
- Overly complicated fallback systems

**Solution**:
- **Simplified Reputation System**: Back to single global parameter `CI_PlayerReputation` (0-100)
- **Removed CBA Dependency**: Mission makers can simply set reputation in `init.sqf`
- **Clean Root Directory**: Removed all test/debug files, kept only essential documentation
- **Streamlined Code**: Removed complex fallback logic and settings validation

### 11. ✅ **Documentation Overhaul**

**Added**:
- **Comprehensive README.md**: Complete installation, usage, and technical documentation
- **BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Step-by-step guide for creating PBO files
- **Enhanced Code Comments**: Better inline documentation for all functions

**Documentation Covers**:
- Installation instructions for players and mission makers
